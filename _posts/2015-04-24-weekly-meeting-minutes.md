 **STUDENT REPORT** 

 *10 Minutes: Report on the current progress regarding thesis, projects, etc.*

The paper proposes an evaluation framework for XLP to assess the dynamics of learning. Then the agent-based model is proposed to observe the effect of implementing different design policies and agency behaviors to serve as a decision support tool for designing future XLP activities. 

XLP has been described as a distributed learning-workflow system. Its distributed architecture designed for concurrent learning in crowds across the physical, disciplinary and cultural boundaries. Theoretically, XLP emulates the computer, with people performing the roles of information processors generating certain inputs and outputs through following the given protocols. A number of literature related to computer science theories on concurrent and distributed computing are reviewed to provide a theoretical framework of the Extreme Learning Process. The review starts from discussion of XLP from a Turing machine perspective, then Actor model and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. 

###XLP and Turing Machine

Turing machine is described as a hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. It is used in thought experiments to examine the abilities and limitations of computers. In essence, a Turing machine is imagined to be a simple computer that reads and writes symbols one at a time on an endless tape by strictly following a set of rules. It determines what action it should perform next according to its internal "state" and what symbol it currently sees. In a deterministic Turing machine, the set of rules prescribes at most one action to be performed for any given situation. A non-deterministic Turing machine (NTM), by contrast, may have a set of rules that prescribes more than one action for a given situation. From this perspective, XLP considers participants information processors that may have turing complete capabilties and the policies related to legal and socioeconomic infrastructures and the XLP constitution as the rules prescribing certain actions in certain situations. This relationship deals with describing each particular participant within the XLP. 

###XLP and Actor Model

On the other hand, it has been argued that Turing machine has certain limitations when dealing with concurrency. Hewitt argues that early models of computation such as Turing machines were based on mathematics and made use of a global state to represent a computational step. This approach was continued in automata theory for finite state machines and nondeterministic automata with properties of bounded nondeterminism; that is, if a machine always halts when started in its initial state, then there is a bound on the number of states in which it halts. Clinger and Carl Hewitt have developed the Actor model of concurrent computation with the property of unbounded nondeterminism. This allows computations that cannot be implemented by Turing Machines, as seen above. 

The Actor Model perspective addresses the concurrency in the XLP system. It treats "actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent computation: in response to a message that it receives, an actor can make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received. The actor model adopts the philosophy that everything is an actor. This is similar to the everything is an object philosophy used by some object-oriented programming languages, but differs in that object-oriented software is typically executed sequentially, while the Actor model is inherently concurrent. There is no assumed sequence to the above actions and they could be carried out in parallel. Decoupling the sender from communications sent was a fundamental advance of the Actor model enabling asynchronous communication and control structures as patterns of passing messages.


Many of the ideas introduced in the Actor model are now also finding application in multi-agent systems for these same reasons [Hewitt 2006b 2007b]. The key difference is that agent systems (in most definitions) impose extra constraints upon the Actors, typically requiring that they make use of commitments and goals.

###XLP and DAO

 On the organizational level, XLP follows the architecture of DAO.   A human organization can be defined as a combination of two things: a set of property, and a protocol for a set of individuals to interact with each other. A decentralized organization involves a set of humans interacting with each other according to a protocol specified in code, and enforced on the blockchain. DAO is a decentralized network of narrow-AI autonomous agents which perform an output-maximizing production function and which divides its labor into computationally intractable tasks (which it incentivizes humans to do) and tasks which it performs itself.

###Logistic Curve (S Curve)

Logistic curves can be used in the wide range of applications. They are used in logistic regression and are also commonly used in machine learning. In XLP it can be used to determine how learning may be affected by one or more variables in the configuration setup. For XLP learning occurs in the growth in the logistic curve and rich contextual data is important to assess what factors influence this growth. With availability of rich data, logistic regressions can allow for better predicitons of learning dynamics in XLP. Agent-based simulation in this context allows to model the ecology of XLP and run simulations with different configurations to determine such relationships between learning and other configuration variables.
