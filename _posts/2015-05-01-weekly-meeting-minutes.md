 **STUDENT REPORT** 

 *10 Minutes: Report on the current progress regarding thesis, projects, etc.*


I have further worked on my simulation model this week. Professor Tsai offered his insights, suggesting that simulation should match the empirical findings from the evaluation framework, including the digital records and patterns.  He emphasized that process data from XLP should match in the simulation through patterns or histogram, he used team communications, file access and edits as an example. I think he has good points, however there are certain concerns I have regarding this approach. I find that patterns in digital records are subject to many factors and not all of them are known to us to be effectively modeled, so simply coding the same behaviors is possible but is not as meaningful. Additionally the model doesn't include as of now any cognitive feature of agents, such as mood, personality, pressure, etc. Thus I think comparisons with the empirical data (which is a very small sample) might not be as accurate. After discussion prof. Tsai suggested that matching accuracy can be as low as 50%, which might possible at this point. To address this I need to redesign the way activities are modeled currently. Since my model treats the XLP as a DAO and simulates the organizational dynamics in the long run rather than a specific 2 or 4 day long event, it generalizes the agent's activities rather than making them very specific. I am proposing to divide activities into fixed categories (e.g. as in XLP's idea generation, coordination, product dev, publishing), so it can support both approaches. Then the model can produce data that can be compared with the data from the past orientation programs. Regarding the coding progress, this week I was able to successfully integrate the dynamic bank system into the model and incorporate social trends among agents, where less successful agents try to imitate the most successful agents.

Additionally I have worked with Jan and Prof. Tsai on updating the paper and discussing the XLP's logic model and how simulations can fit within the XLP's long term plan. Many great points and ideas came from discussions and the updated paper has been sent out.

***Kuba***:

This coming week I am planning to incorporate the categories withing the structure of agent's activities and see if the comparable results can be produced. At the same time I am working on gathering the literature for my thesis.
