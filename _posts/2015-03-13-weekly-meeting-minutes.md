 **STUDENT REPORT** 

 *10 Minutes: Report on the current progress regarding thesis, projects, etc.*

I have focused past week on figuring out some techniques for mining data from Git. I found a book called [Mining Social Web](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition)  with available tools to mine data from GitHub using python. I wasn't able to configure a correct environment for the provided tool, but further digging showed that this tool is more appropriate for researching social behaviors of contributors to GitHub repos based on their contributions to various repos and programming languages they use. This is a good reference in general, but doesn't directly apply for our purposes.

Further analysis of the available Git repositories from previous XLP sessions revealed that the use of Chinese characters in directory names cannot be correctly shown by Git when running git log commands. This poses a problem since all the directory paths which were written in Chinese become unreadable, making analysis troublesome. 

The state of existing Git repos doesn't contain a continuous history of files, due to participants not following the correct workflows during merges. Thus blame analysis shows only a quarter of participants as contributors to the final repo content, which is probably not the actual case. For future events, I suggest avoiding big team splits OR a much closer monitor the git activity and directory structures.

Me, Ben, Echo and Zimmer also went to Beihang University to meet with Prof. Tsai and discuss current situation with XLP. Prof. Tsai emphasized on the need for more research and academic backing of XLP to move forward.
