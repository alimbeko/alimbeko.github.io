 **STUDENT REPORT** 

 *10 Minutes: Report on the current progress regarding thesis, projects, etc.*


I have further worked on my simulation model this week. Professor Tsai requested a more thorough write up about the simulation, which I have sent out to him and Ben today. The write up has a comparison of the simulation results and the empirical data, as requested by Prof. Tsai and so far results seem to be following similar patterns. This serves as a reason to further proceed to simulation experiments in the following week. I will wait for prof. Tsai's feedback and go on with experiments. I have also further worked on the draft of the master's thesis paper following the same outline as shown below:
