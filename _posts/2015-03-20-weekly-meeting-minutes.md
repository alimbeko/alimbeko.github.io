 **STUDENT REPORT** 

 *10 Minutes: Report on the current progress regarding thesis, projects, etc.*

Continuing from past week I have tried to set up the GitHub mining tool, but I wasn't able to set correct configurations neither at my laptop, nor at the office Mac. Since it was just for reference only, I think it's not a big deal and I shouldn't spend too much time on it.

Also I continued investigating the analogues between Multi-Agent Systems and XLP framework. This lead me to several papers on modelling crowd behaviror. Furthermore, on Thursday, I attended a guest lecture by prof. Shi Cao from University of Waterloo about the human performance modelling using cognitive architechture. It was of particular interest as prof. Cao gave insights on how simulations can be of value and bring interesting results. I have previously also researched different methods used for modelling human performance and simulating cognitive architevetures, such as ACT-R. CLARION, Soar etc. Prof. Cao's work mainly focuses on individual human performance, like when a person is driving a car, how good is his driving. For my case, however, I want to look at the collective performance as well. This lead me to the topic of Agent-Based Social Simulations (ABSS). This has been a popular area for modeling various social behaviors and many simulation tools exist already. I have downloaded and have been using SeSAm modelling software, which is a free software under GNU license. It has a very intuitive UI and I think it will allow me to simulate the XLP model. While I dont have a comprehensive mathematical model for XLP, as it generally is very complex and flexible, I think dividng and modelling main XLP activites might reduce the complexitity.  This will be my focus for the next week to try out different models, including the influence model for Idea Flow in the SeSAm simulation. Furthermore, if simulations work out well, the experiement can be designed to compare the results.

I have also worked with Zimmer on defining the XLP in the white paper according to Ben's following comments on XLP:


XLP has 3 main features

1. Organize any working learning events as a complete microcosm of society. Trans-disciplinary learning activity, rich learning experience, proven to be more interesting if designed properly (Amortize the cost of developping different kinds of learning material, by combining the context for one course to bring all of the together).
2. To do this well we divide up the learning sessions into 2 sessions: logic model and 635 method to organize all stakeholders, to cocreate and design the learning activity as a part of learning program. After unit test of the program, we do a mission execution session to try out hte execution of the learning program. THe whole process is a service design experiement. So this uniques course construction prohject, mamkes it possible ot adapt the human resources to reflect the needs of participationg performaners and also adress the tehcnical, finanaioal needs of people on site or connected through internet, so we can use the same organizational principle to design the. ITs supported by the 4 forces mechanism, so it is instuitutionalized infrastructure or services that we provide to all xlp sessions, including to all challenge design and mission execution sessions.
3. Using digital technologies/dist. workflow we were able to track mutually witnessing the change/progress records and also various forms of learning behaviors, incl. video, photo, textual statements about their own work. And using all open-source and free internet scalable resources so that we can replicate that over time and space, incl. using social formats of interactivity such as ipodia to reach out to many distributed learning locations both simlutaneously and over time. 

- combine disciplines for amortizing costs; (major)
- collective self-directed learning, learner designed activities: challenge design, mission execution;  (course)
- institutionalized motivational mechanisms, protocols, coordination;  (syllabus)
- scalability through distributed workflow. (classroom	)
