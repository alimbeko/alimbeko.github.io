 **STUDENT REPORT** 

 *10 Minutes: Report on the current progress regarding thesis, projects, etc.*

This week I continued working on the model and began the programming of the model in NetLogo. Tony is going to help me program it, he is currently learning NetLogo. A lot of good point came out of the discussion with Ben this week about the importance of this project. 

Ben introduced to me the notion of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and their layered architecture, which fits well with the XLP framework. XLP uses certain layers of Distributed Autonomous Organizations to enhance learning through dynamic policy adjustments. The importance of distributed autonomouse organizations has been recently emphasized. Rise of distributed security technologies like BlockChain provide a firmer platform for the development of new applications of distributed computation and organizations. In such distributed environments many processes can occur simultaneously and the interactions between system entities can take place in different spatial and temporal dimensions.  

Learning is a dynamic process. Learning in organizations plays an important role in attining a competitive edge and pushing further development. In my work I focus on the so called distrobuted autonomous organizations. The rise of DAO has recently been emphasized with the development of technologies like Blockchain and advances in distributed computing fields. Extreme Learning Process, as a colective learning framework, facilitates learning within the distributed environment and provides dynamic policy adjustment mechanisms, which accomodate different interactions and processes.  A number of XLP-based activites have been held over past several years at Tsinghua University. The data from these events, like the digital repositories, digital transactions and legal disputes provided many insights on how people fit within XLP framework as distributed information processors. Recent research papers include the 2012 distributed OS by Gu Xueyong and 2015 XLP Evaluation Framework Case Study by WT Tsai and me. Based on these works we construct an agent-based simulation model as a kind of decision-support and dynamic adjustment tool.  

In Saturday, April 11th, there will be a midterm check for the master thesis research progress at our department. I have prepared a set of slides and the progress report, to present at the meeting. The slides have been uploaded to the Teambition project in Toyhouse Office/Docs. The report has been reviewed and signed by Ben on April 9th.
