 **STUDENT REPORT** 

 *10 Minutes: Report on the current progress regarding thesis, projects, etc.*

This past week I continued working on developing the theoretical background for my thesis. I have looked into the game theory and machine learning and figured several perspectives which could apply to XLP. From machine learning point of view, there are different types of learning, like Reinforcement Learning and Q-Learning for multi-agent systems. Another interesting approach is Evolutionary Game Theory, where the players need to adapt and are not completely rational, constrained by biological and social conditions. I think this approach could be more helpful when taking into consideration the human factors from the XLP participants. Given that EGT is mainly a competitive game, so to address collaboration, I have also looked into the cooperative games, specifically related to conflict resolutions and decision making. In the context of crowd-learning, I think decisions on knowledge sharing and distribution of collective payoffs become important.  

I have also worked on providing the following information to teachers from Heilongjiang:

I have also attended GMS and GIS classes this week and worked with Zhang Hang to install Lunr.js search on toyhouse-xlp.gitcafe.io. Unfortunately, lunr.js is nt supported by Gitcafe Pages nor by Github Pages. So a simpler site search, like google custom search will need to be installed. Once we get the new website with out own hosting and servers, we can install Solr search.
 

**FEEDBACK **
 
 *10 Minutes: Professor's feedback regarding student's current progress.*
 
 The focus for the following several weeks at Toyhouse is to to write XLP positioning paper to formally define what is XLP, its missions, goals and objectives. This should provide a good foundation for my thesis and better explain the importance of the work I conduct.

Echo also has prepared the outline for the XLP defining slides with a better story. This can be modified.
